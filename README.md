# Time Series & Category Charts – Sales Analysis

This project analyzes sales data using time series and category-based visualizations.
It was completed as part of the Syntecxhub Virtual Internship program.

## Dataset
- Sample Superstore dataset

## Objectives
- Analyze sales trends over time using line charts
- Aggregate sales by month
- Compare sales across product categories using bar charts
- Visualize category contribution using pie charts
- Apply proper chart labeling, legends, and axis formatting
- Export charts as image files

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Visualizations
- **Line Chart:** Monthly sales trend over time
- **Bar Chart:** Total sales by product category
- **Pie Chart:** Sales share by category

## Summary
A line chart was used to visualize sales trends over time because it clearly shows growth
patterns and fluctuations across months. Bar charts were used to compare category-level
sales performance, while a pie chart highlighted each category’s contribution to total sales.
Proper titles, axis labels, and legends were applied to improve clarity and readability.

## Output Files
- `monthly_sales_trend.png`
- `category_sales_bar_chart.png`
- `category_sales_pie_chart.png`

This project demonstrates practical data visualization skills and time series analysis
using Python.
